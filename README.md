# Assemble Database

## Overview

Assemble Database is a decentralized database management system built on the Stacks blockchain. This project provides a secure, transparent, and immutable database infrastructure using smart contracts.

## Key Features

- Decentralized database registry
- Granular data access management
- Secure database controller
- Advanced security module

## Architecture

The system comprises four core smart contracts:

1. **Database Registry**: Manages database metadata and registration
2. **Data Access Manager**: Controls read/write permissions
3. **Database Controller**: Handles database operations and state management
4. **Security Module**: Implements access control and security protocols

## Smart Contracts

### database-registry
Manages database metadata, registration, and core attributes.

Key features:
- Database creation and registration
- Metadata tracking
- Ownership verification
- Database status management

### data-access-manager
Controls granular access permissions for database interactions.

Key features:
- Read and write permission management
- Access role definition
- Dynamic permission updates
- Secure access control mechanisms

### database-controller
Handles core database operations and state management.

Key features:
- Database state manipulation
- Transaction logging
- Atomic operation support
- Consistency enforcement

### security-module
Implements advanced security protocols for database protection.

Key features:
- Multi-layered access control
- Threat detection
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Clarinet
- Stacks Blockchain
- Node.js

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/assemble-database.git
cd assemble-database
clarinet integrate
```

## Development

```bash
clarinet test     # Run contract tests
clarinet check    # Static contract analysis
```

## Security Considerations

- Granular access control mechanisms
- Comprehensive permission management
- Secure database state transitions
- Transparent audit trails
- Protection against unauthorized access

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain.
